Our group studies the roles and regulation of alternative RNAs in the nervous system.

We are part of the [Dept. of Genetics and Genome Sciences](https://health.uconn.edu/genetics/) at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine in Farmington, CT.

What do we work on?  

======

The Miura lab studies RNA. How is it made? How are the pieces of mRNAs put together? What are the roles of alternative exons and Untranslated Regions (UTRs) in gene expression?

We use various model systems, including mammalian cells that can differentiate into neurons in culture and the fruit flyâ€“ Drosophila melanogaster.

**What's new?**

We moved from Nevada to Connecticut in 2022. We are searching for our first grad student in CT! Contact Dr. Miura if you are interested in a rotation! 

We accept students in the [Genetics and Developmental Biology area of concentration](https://health.uconn.edu/graduate-school/academics/programs/ph-d-biomedical-science/genetics-and-developmental-biology-area-of-concentration/)
